**Note on “DecafJokers”**  
DecafJokers is not an independent group. It is a single-owner vanity server operated exclusively by the individual RevGirl. It exists solely as her personal meme army and coordination node. All observed 764-pattern activity attributed to this entity originates from RevGirl herself.

**Universal Camouflage**  
Every listed entity publicly presents as “anti-degen” or “anti-pedo” while privately employing 764-derived coercion frameworks.
