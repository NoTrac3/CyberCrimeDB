**Updated from October 13, 2025 Brief**  

## Executive Summary
DPOS (Degeneracy Police Order State) is no longer a shadowy troll collective—it's a documented federal target, its "anti-degen" facade shattered by a 72-hour evidence storm that exposed doxxing rings, swatting threats, grooming pipelines, and blackmail campaigns. Emerging as a "hardcore" UTTP offshoot in mid-2023, DPOS escalated juvenile raids into psychological warfare, targeting FPE, Gacha, and LGBTQ+ communities under the guise of moral policing. Led by TomasThyGreatest, it fed into 764 sextortion and Spawnism self-harm cults, manipulating kids (mostly 14 and under) into chaos tools. NoTrac3's investigations, culminating in November 2025 exposures, revealed 1,750+ linked accounts in the DTAD database, including RevGirl52's minor-adult matchmaking and Lola Bear's 47 extortion tweets. The mask is off: DPOS isn't protection—it's predation. Report to FBI IC3. Platforms: Ban the tag. Parents: Monitor Discord/Roblox. Knowledge severs the pipeline. The cycle ends now.

## Section 1: DPOS Origins – Forged in UTTP's Fractured Wake
DPOS didn't spring from nowhere. It was born from the ashes of UTTP (UtubeTrollPolice), a chaotic 2011 troll group that devolved from GoAnimate skits into a decade of digital toxicity. By mid-2023, UTTP's internal wars—Hyper Bat Mapping's betrayal and StrongMoonMan's counter—splintered it into offshoots. DPOS emerged as the "extremist arm," founded amid that infighting as a self-proclaimed "hardcore" enforcer against "degeneracy" (anime, LGBTQ+ content, fandoms like FPE and Gacha). It inherited UTTP's raid tactics but amplified them with ideological venom, posing as moral guardians while hiding grooming and hate.

TomasThyGreatest (Brazil) was the architect. A UTTP recruit since 2022, he seized the moment in July 2023 to declare DPOS, branding it with a burning anime eye logo. His X (@TomasThyGreatest) spewed Nazi lingo, tying "policing degeneracy" to 764 nihilism. Early ops: Discord spams, YouTube doxxes, FPE forum vandalism (Miss Circle gore edits, October 3, 2025). Allies like ZTTP and YFGA shared Telegram for "clout"—gore trades masking CSAM. Thousands flooded the servers. Kid recruits (14 and under) were twisted into "evil monsters,". DPOS wasn't rebirth; it was evolution—UTTP's chaos hardened into a blade.

## Section 2: The Rise of DPOS – From Raids to Radicalization
DPOS hit the ground running in mid-2023, midwifed by UTTP's collapse. Tomas positioned it as the "pure" successor, "policing" anime and LGBTQ+ spaces with raids that blended humor and hate. Discord became the fortress: thousands joined, spinoffs like AUTTP infiltrated by ex-members. YouTube bans (OfficerSlappy) and X reports (October 3, 2025) slowed them, but resilience came from manipulated minors—fed "degenerate" slurs, death threats, cult chants.

Tomas' ascent was swift. By 2024, he was Führer, his feed a storm of neo-Nazi rhetoric and 764 ties. Leaks showed alts building a "footprint" for tracking (October 13 chats). Operations escalated: psychological ops like FPE targeting (doxxing Katie, minor harassment, echoing UTTP's Gachafall hacks). "Degeneracy" became code for anything non-conforming—anime eyes, rainbow flags. By 2025, raids fed grooming: kids lured for DDOS, broken for self-harm rituals under Spawnism. FBI bounties on Chezble linked to DPOS Telegram gore. The scale: 1,750+ DTAD accounts, thousands in servers, zero structure—just Tomas' venom steering the chaos.

The mask worked. "Anti-degen" veiled the blade: homophobia as "purity," racism as "jokes," grooming as "recruitment." Parents saw clout-chasing. Platforms saw fandom beef. But peel it back, and it's a hub for depravity—neo-Nazism, anti-Christianity, O9A bonds. Reddit's r/anti_uttp branded DPOS the "depraved core," perpetuating spinoffs like ZTTP. It thrived on the lie: protectors, not predators.

## Section 3: The Mask Cracks – Crimes, Exposure, and Collapse
The facade held until November 2025, when @AnonCatalyst_ cracked it in 72 hours of relentless exposure. DPOS's crimes—doxxing, swatting, blackmail—unraveled live. Tomas' "wrath therapy" raids masked 100+ suicide ideations and gore obsessions. RevGirl52, the matchmaking queen, leaked AnonCatalyst_'s card digits and address, confessing adulthood 47 times ("into adult hood," "when I was young") while running minor-adult servers ("all straight females under 18 💀"). Lola Bear's 47 extortion tweets ("we even have your thirsty texts 🙂 well bye") backfired into self-conviction.

Swatting orders ("respond or I send pizza") and murder plots ("super soldier st#k!ll or force surrender") fed the pipeline: UTTP lures, DPOS hooks, 764 harvests. Zytherox's eight-year-old grooming brags, Chezble bounties, #SHTWT carvings—all traced to DPOS Telegram. The "anti-degen" tag? Shattered. X Legal's 1 GB packet + IC3 filings exposed the ring. Tomas perma-nuked. RevGirl ghosted since October 28, fleeing groupchats. Lola's cope buried at 0 likes. Servers burned: DPOS main banned, 4+ hubs gone. Firebase a laughing stock, Flipper-ready—legacy as "depraved hub" eternal.

NoTrac3's DTAD database mapped 1,750+ accounts. The mask is ash. DPOS can't rebuild—platforms flag "anti-degen" as harassment. The cycle ends: report to IC3, monitor Roblox/Discord, protect the vulnerable.

## Section 4: The Human Toll and the Path Forward
DPOS/UTTP weren't pranks—they were gateways to trauma. Kids groomed for DDOS became self-harm victims; FPE faced doxxing suicides. Parents missed it until too late. logs, Lola felonies. m77u1n's filed (police report) sealed it.

Forward: Awareness severs the pipeline. Platforms: Ban the tags. Feds: Prosecute the Führer. NoTrac3 warns: Knowledge ends the cycle. Share this brief. Watch them burn.
