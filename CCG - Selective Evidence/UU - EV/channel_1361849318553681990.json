The ideology of the Universal Union is a combination of multiple others, highlighting useful points and removing the unnecessary.                                    \nAt its core, the Universal Union is a force of assimilation. It absorbs every member group into its structure, directing them through an interconnected web of communication and ideology. These groups are not just followers; they are instruments—focused, refined, and deployed to extend the Union’s reach and magnify its ideals.\nThe ideology of the Universal Union is a blend of meritocracy and technocracy, combining the best aspects of both, making it so that the best and most devoted individuals have the most permissions and control.At the same time, the Union is entirely focused on maintaining control and its supremacy on the internet. This is achieved through diplomatic agreements, advantages, and attacks—also gaining power from controversy, terraforming the environment of its expansion to adapt to any medium, in order to digest and make use of the maximum amount of resources possible.\nIn the Universal Union, the progress of all group members is pursued through knowledge. These members, in turn, create and structure an empire outside the control of any government, where anyone—man, woman, or child—can serve the greater good of collaboration within the Universal Union.\u001b[0m\n``` @​everyone @​here",
