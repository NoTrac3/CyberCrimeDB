So while doing undercover investigations on a known UTTP group by request of [N/A] we have found quite a bit of interesting information. This UTTP Group is named [𝗗𝗲𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗢𝗦] The owner is [tomasthegreatest2] Which ill look further into next. we began by joining their server and looking through their lists, iv found a fimilar person of intrest who goes by [LilRage], he is the captain in DPO. [LilRage] is in a server called [4th] also known as 4th bigrade a popular extortion com server, hes also in [The Militia | Tm] which is a very well known anti-degen server run my a hate group full of extremists, also note that iv seen [LilRage] publicly post on doxbin.com meaning he is malicious. (Ill begin tracing LilRage in LilRage.txt)
