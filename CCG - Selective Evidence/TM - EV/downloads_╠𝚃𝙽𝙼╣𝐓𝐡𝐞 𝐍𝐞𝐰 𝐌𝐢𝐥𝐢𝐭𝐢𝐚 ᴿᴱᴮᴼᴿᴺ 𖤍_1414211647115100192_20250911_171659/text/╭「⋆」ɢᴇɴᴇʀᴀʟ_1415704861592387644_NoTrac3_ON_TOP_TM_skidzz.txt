|Cody Pavasco, a die-hard Notre Dame fan from Indiana, passionately believes Tommy Rees should be fired for his shaky play-calling, while juggling Twitch streaming and a love for F1’s midfield chaos.
|CPavasco’s been hyping up Lions football, roasting Purdue, and geeking out over NCAA gaming lately.
|Profile Basics: Cody Pavasco’s handle is @CPavasco
|. His bio states: “Notre Dame fan | Indiana | Twitch: CPavasco | Inquiries: cpavasco@gmail.com.” This suggests he’s based in Indiana, likely an adult given his interests (sports, gaming, F1), and has a public email for contact. No explicit age is listed, but his content implies he’s at least in his 20s.
|Content Themes: His posts revolve around sports (Notre Dame football, Detroit Lions), gaming (NCAA gaming, Twitch streaming), and F1 racing. Recent activity includes:
|Hyping Lions football: “Lions going to the Super Bowl confirmed” (March 31, 2025).
|Roasting Purdue: “Lmaoooooooo Purdue ” (date unclear, but recent).
|Gaming enthusiasm: “NCAA gaming is back baby” (paraphrased from recent posts).
|Critique of Tommy Rees: Frequent calls for firing Notre Dame’s offensive coordinator over play-calling, e.g., “Tommy Rees needs to go” (recurring theme).
|Engagement Style: Casual, opinionated, and sports-centric. He interacts with followers via Twitch and X, suggesting a small but engaged audience. No red flags like overt sexual content or references to minors appear in his public posts.
|Links and Media: His Twitch (twitch.tv/cpavasco) is linked, but I can’t access live streams or past broadcasts without real-time interaction. No other external content (e.g., images, PDFs) is directly uploaded to X that I can analyze here.
|Additional Details for Tracking
|Location: Indiana, per his bio. This narrows it to a state level—likely near Notre Dame (South Bend area) given his fandom, though not confirmed.
|Email: cpavasco@gmail.com.
|Twitch Handle: CPavasco. Streaming platform
|Online Footprint: Active on X and Twitch, suggesting a consistent digital presence. No other socials (e.g., Instagram, YouTube) are explicitly linked, but a deeper search could reveal more.
