Just keep in mind we will not be going after any UTTP or AUTTP related persons.
But we can discuss them if needed.

So uhhh…
Were still keeping the thread up?
Noah, Bystial Enthusiast — 7/17/25, 9:43 PM
Yeah, just as a place to discuss and log what happened really
Not as an operation because... Obviously dealing with UTTP is a bad idea.

True cause it can risk alot of people’s safety in general.
Noah, Bystial Enthusiast — 7/17/25, 9:44 PM
Just need to keep things organized
This might get discussed for a few days and that's why we have the thread
