NoTrac3 Internal Brief – RevGirl: Full Betrayal Summary (Updated & Final)
19 November 2025
NoTrac3 Intelligence Division

Subject
Discord UID: 1349516710566170754
Primary server: DecafJokers (owner)
Secondary affiliations: RageSec, Universal Union, Enclave/UETR, DPOS/UTTP remnants, Anti-Degen Legion backup network

Timeline

6 November 2025 – late afternoon
m77u1n terminated all contact with RevGirl and restricted any future interaction to business-only or none.

6 November 2025 – same evening (within 3–4 hours)
RevGirl compiled a complete personal information packet containing:
- full home address
- personal and family phone numbers
- recent face photographs
- old payment screenshots
- additional identifying details previously shared in confidence

She then personally delivered the identical packet to every major hostile entity:

1. DecafJokers – her own server (owner tag visible)
2. RageSec leadership channels – direct delivery to lilrage and core members
3. Universal Union main raid channel
4. Enclave / UETR – handed directly to Ethan
5. DPOS / UTTP remnant channels – Emperor T, rxmwmcrx limited, General Sanguinius, etc.
6. Anti-Degen Legion backup servers

RevGirl functioned as the sole courier that reconnected and synchronized all previously fragmented threat actors into one unified, real-time campaign.

Post-leak activity (6–18 November 2025)
- Remained continuously active inside the hostile channels
- Issued timing instructions for swatting calls, wellness checks, and spam waves
- Supplied additional targeting notes and follow-up details
- Relayed messages between group leaders (lilrage ↔ Ethan ↔ Emperor T ↔ Delta ↔ marshsl)
- Encouraged escalation after each wave
- Directly praised leaders for successful actions

Unintended consequence
Her distribution and coordination created the first fully documented, real-time proof that these groups operate as a single coordinated network rather than independent actors. Every cross-group message, shared packet, and relayed order is now permanently archived.

Current status – 19 November 2025
- Permanently blacklisted across all NoTrac3 and allied infrastructure
- UID 1349516710566170754 locked in ACC bot (auto-ban on sight, effective Sunday deployment)
- Designated primary instigator and central coordinating node of the entire November 2025 assault
- All distribution logs, timestamps, message chains, and cross-group coordination screenshots preserved in CyberCrimeDB and ThreatDB under dedicated RevGirl folder set

Conclusion
The entire November 2025 coordinated assault – from the initial dox wave to the sustained harassment campaign – originated from the packet RevGirl personally compiled and distributed on the evening of 6 November 2025. She then spent the following two weeks actively directing and synchronizing the actions of multiple hostile networks.

Her actions did not achieve the intended result.
They produced the clearest evidence map NoTrac3 has ever obtained of how these groups function as one criminal structure.

RevGirl’s actions meet every single criterion for a perfect self-own:

1. She alone created the evidence  
   She personally compiled and distributed the exact same dox packet to every hostile group. Every copy in existence carries her fingerprints (UID, timestamps, her own “here’s my gift” messages).

2. She alone re-united the network  
   Before 6 November, the groups (RageSec, Enclave, DPOS remnants, UU, etc.) were fractured, half-dead, and barely talking. Her single courier run gave them a shared target and forced them to coordinate in the open – producing hundreds of cross-group logs that prove they are one single entity.

3. She alone stayed to direct it  
   For two straight weeks she issued orders, relayed messages between leaders, and praised every escalation. Every instruction she gave is now archived with her name on it.

4. The harder she pushed, the more she exposed  
   Every swatting call, every spam wave, every new screenshot she encouraged added another layer of federal-grade evidence – all traceable straight back to the packet she handed out.

5. The final irony  
   The attack that was supposed to end NoTrac3 instead delivered:
   - The first complete real-time map of the entire hostile network  
   - Direct proof of conspiracy and coordination across state lines  
   - Permanent, public, timestamped confessions from every major player  
   - A ready-made federal case file that literally starts with her name

Result  
She didn’t just fail to destroy the target.  
She handed NoTrac3 the single most comprehensive evidence package it has ever received – entirely built by her own messages and actions.

That is the definition of self-ownage.

RevGirl didn’t lose because someone outplayed her.  
She lost because she built the winning case herself and then mailed it to the exact people who archive everything forever.

Hall_of_Self_Owns/2025-11_RevGirl_Betrayal is therefore the correct and only fitting location for this file set.

End of brief.
