### NoTrac3 Operation Document: Operation Fury's End

**Operation Name:** Operation Fury's End  
**Classification:** NT3 - Internal Alliance Use Only  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issued By:** NoTrac3 Covenant Intelligence Division  
**Operation Lead:** m77u1n (AnonCatalyst_)  

#### Operation Overview
Operation Fury's End is a targeted intelligence and disruption initiative against the threat group **RageSec** and its leader **lilrage**, effective immediately. This operation addresses RageSec's role as a high-priority cyber threat entity, with confirmed links to Roach148, the 148 branch of 764, TomasThyGreatest, DPOS, UTTP, and UU—all blacklisted entities. RageSec's manipulative recruitment, psychological operations, and alliance with extremist cults pose an imminent risk to minors and online communities. The operation aims to isolate, degrade, and erase RageSec's influence.

#### Target Entities
1. **Threat Group: RageSec**  
   - **Description:** RageSec is a decentralized harassment and recruitment network operating primarily on Discord, functioning as a splinter faction with deep ties to blacklisted groups. It specializes in psychological manipulation, doxxing, and coordinated raids, often targeting vulnerable users for grooming and cult indoctrination. Blacklisted due to associations with Roach148 (148/764 branch), TomasThyGreatest (DPOS leader), UTTP, and UU. RageSec's structure is fluid, with 50-100 members across servers, relying on informal roles like "kingdom/guard" for recruiters. Its operations blend trolling with extremism, using spam reporting and infiltration to expand influence.
   - **Known Activities:** Spam reporting campaigns, server infiltration, and recruitment of minors for destructive ops. Evidence includes doxx attempts on allies (e.g., pizza doxxing incidents) and coordination with 148 for extortion and swatting, targeting individuals as young as 11. RageSec's tactics include love-bombing to build trust before blackmail, facilitating self-harm and CSAM production in Spawnism-linked servers.
   - **Threat Level:** Very High (9/10) – Active recruitment and psychological tactics; potential for rapid escalation if unchecked. Blacklisting stems from documented ties to 764's nihilistic extremism, contributing to global grooming networks affecting thousands of minors.

2. **Threat Actor: lilrage**  
   - **Description:** lilrage is the leader of RageSec, a central facilitator in its operations. Listed in NoTrac3's DTAD database (ID: 1405638333551611956) for harassment and manipulation. Direct connections to Roach148 (148/764 branch), TomasThyGreatest (DPOS/UTTP), and UU, with evidence of doxx attempts and server purges. lilrage's X handle is @LilRage (User ID: 16882301), with a bio "The only person I hate more than myself is YOU!" and 9 followers. Additional suspected handles include @Moony123__ (User ID: 1359136186934165510, 448 followers, bio "No longer accepting follow requests") and @lilrage_0 (User ID: 1249885801229488128, 475 followers, bio "Phil 4:13 ask me why my name is the way it is. #girldad father of Zaraya").
   - **Known Activities:** Oversees RageSec raids, ally purges (e.g., limited guy in Enclave), and psychological targeting. Suspected Australian/British origin; operates via Discord and X. lilrage has been linked to UTTP since at least 2023, with RageSec serving as a recruitment feeder for 148/764, including swatting and extortion of minors. His role in DPOS/UTTP coordination includes facilitating doxxing and server infiltrations, contributing to grooming pipelines that tie into Spawnism's self-harm rituals.
   - **Threat Level:** High (8.5/10) – Central to RageSec's structure; high risk of retaliation if isolated. DTAD listing and purge history make him a linchpin for collapse, with connections to blacklisted entities amplifying his threat.

#### Reasons for Classification as Cyber Threat Entity
RageSec and lilrage are designated as a cyber threat entity due to their systemic role in a broader network of manipulation and exploitation:
- **Associations and Reasons:** RageSec maintains direct operational ties to Roach148, a key figure in the 148 branch of 764, a blacklisted cult known for nihilistic extremism, grooming, and swatting incidents (e.g., extortion of 11-year-olds, October 14, 2025). These links enable RageSec to access 764's resources for psychological warfare, including love-bombing minors for blackmail and self-harm rituals. RageSec also collaborates with TomasThyGreatest of DPOS and UTTP for coordinated raids and doxxing, facilitating the spread of neo-Nazi rhetoric and anti-LGBTQ+ harassment. Ties to UU (Universal Union) further integrate RageSec into a web of troll factions, allowing cross-server infiltration and recruitment of vulnerable teens (ages 12-16) for destructive ops. These associations make RageSec a feeder for 764's global grooming network, contributing to thousands of affected minors and aligning with FBI's 250+ probes into related extremism.
- **Cyber Threat Justification:** RageSec's tactics—spam reporting, server purges, and psychological targeting—create a persistent risk to online safety, enabling the radicalization and exploitation of youth. Blacklisting is warranted by their role in blacklisted ecosystems, with lilrage's DTAD entry confirming his facilitation of these threats. This classification prioritizes immediate disruption to prevent escalation into real-world harm.

#### Operational Phases
1. **Phase I: Intelligence Gathering (Immediate - T+3 Days)**  
   - Compile DTAD entries and server logs for lilrage (ID: 1405638333551611956).  
   - Map connections to Roach148, TomasThyGreatest, DPOS, UTTP, and UU via Discord IDs and X posts.  

2. **Phase II: Disruption (T+3 to T+7 Days)**  
   - Execute ban wave on RageSec servers using ACC bot and allied reports.  
   - Isolate lilrage through doxxing of his Australian/British ties and raid history.  

3. **Phase III: Eradication (T+7 to T+14 Days)**  
   - Erase RageSec via OPH/ICAC handoff for grooming evidence.  
   - Blacklist lilrage across alliances, preventing rebirth.

#### Threat Assessment
- **RageSec Danger:** 9/10 – Blacklisted alliances make it a priority; rapid minor recruitment heightens urgency.  
- **lilrage Danger:** 8.5/10 – DTAD listing and purge history make him a linchpin for collapse.  

#### Execution Notes
- Adhere to NoTrac3 Creed (v2, IV) – justice without blind aggression.  
- Coordinate with SRA for purge intel (October 14 chat).  
- Update via NoTrac3 channels post-Phase I.
