**I-report**
- DPOS - Tomas The Greatest is playing right into our hands, recently him and his minions attempted to raid our gate discord servers and our main discord server but their attempts were haulted and we let them sit for a few minutes so they can bring more. They played right into our hands giving us the ID and Usernames of all his main people and more. He is now trying to get m77u1n's discord account banned the current dirctor of NoTrac3 but m77u1n knows secrets he doesnt so his account will be fine. He recently made a video about NoTrac3 making false claims and putting words in our mouths. This and his future actions will only be fuel to his downfall when we close the book and drop everything and start our offensive. Right now we are just gonna sit back and let him keep coming to us and playing our game. They seem mad, we must be doing something right. We are deep into their network purging us from their internal network is impossible now.

**II-report**
- DPOS - __Report Spam Attack__ on m77u1n's discord account has failed and his account has been cleared of any recent flags [DEFENSIVE COMPLETED] DPOS FAILED...

**III-report**
- DPOS __DDos Attack Attempts__ Our web server hosting service brought our web server offline due to detected ddos attacks. The reason for Shinjiru to hold our server until we secured the issue is to protect the server from further damage, a perfect system they have setup I must admit. During its down time we secured the attack and any future attacks on multiple levels and setup attack alerts so we can respond immediately. Yet another DPOS attack failure thanks to Shinjiru for their security. [DEFENSIVE COMPLETED] DPOS FAILED...

*DDoS PROTECTION DEPLOYED:*
> Kernel SYN flood protection :white_check_mark:
> iptables DDoS rules :white_check_mark: (50 conns/IP max)
> Fail2Ban (20 reqs/min → 24h ban) :white_check_mark:
> Caddy security headers :white_check_mark:
> BBR TCP acceleration :white_check_mark:

*FOR AN EXTRA LAYER:* `CrowdSec (& Fail2Ban) monitors Caddy logs for attacks. Automatically bans malicious IPs via firewall (iptables). Low maintenance (self-updates via CrowdSec’s threat feed).`

*NOTE_from:* __m77u1n__ ```DPOS tried to get my discord account banned but I did a neat trick to keep it safe and went on an alt so the account is fine. that was an L for them. They tried to raid our server and got halted and logged and banned which is the second L for DPOS and then they tried to ddos our website but thanks to our web service providers security systems the server was fine and we had plenty of time to work on the web server and secure it against the attacks and any other future attacks the website is solid now all they did there was help us secure our systems and let us know its time to finish setting up our community discord server. Overall their attempts to attack us has and me directly resulted in better security systems and them getting logged and blacklisted and added to our CyberCrimeDB.```

**IV-report**
- DPOS attempted to breach our X account and got blocked instead. They tried to brag and claim they doxxed m77u1n but we hold it as a trophy of their failure. We dont like to brag but 5 days ago we were able to get YouTube to take a look at and take down a video of theirs targeting a victim. Previously they tried to raid our discord server and ddos our website and get m77u1n discord account banned but all attempts failed and resulted in improved security measures. 

**V-report**
- We received a notice from a victim that the DPOS YouTube channel was taken down a week ago:

**VI-report**
- We are currently focused on construction on our website for more private communications. Operations are proceeding quietly and steadily against DPOS. Details are not going to be shared until further development is made within our operations. Tomas the lead of DPOS has been trying to bait m77u1n into traps as a pathetic last attempt to have some sort of amo against us. We will not stop our rain against them and we havent even gone on our offensive yet. DPOS surrender is no longer an option beyond this point.

**VII-report**

HTTP_400s — DPOS's server is actively rejecting, but accounts are still getting through.

**VIII-report**
