NoTrac3 Official Withdrawal Document
Date: October 16, 2025Subject: Formal Withdrawal from Operations Against TNM - The New Militia and FantoTo the NoTrac3 Alliance, OPH, SRA, and Allied Networks,After months of dedicated effort to dismantle the TNM - The New Militia and Fanto networks, I, m77u1n (AnonCatalyst_), hereby announce the official withdrawal of NoTrac3 from these operations, effective immediately. This decision stems from the critical failure to receive an updated victim report, which was essential to completing the mission.Background:
Since the official investigation was announced on 2025-08-09 under OPERATION IRONFALL: TARGET GROUP LOG REPORT by the Covenant Intel Division, NoTrac3 has invested significant resources—intelligence gathering, psyops execution (ISOLATE, DEGRADE, ERASE), and alliance coordination—to cripple TNM - The New Militia and Fanto. Our efforts have successfully paused their operations and exposed vulnerabilities, notably through the DTAD database (1,750+ accounts) and UTTP linkages. However, the absence of a new victim report, lost due to circumstances beyond my control, has halted progress on the erasure phase.Reason for Withdrawal:
The victim report was a linchpin for finalizing the takedown, providing legal and operational clarity. Repeated delays and lack of cooperation from the primary victim source have rendered further action untenable. This is not a reflection of NoTrac3’s commitment but a pragmatic response to resource constraints and unmet dependencies.Current Status:TNM - The New Militia and Fanto remain isolated and degraded but not fully erased.
Existing intel (e.g., UTTP associations) remains available for allied use.
NoTrac3 will redirect focus to other threats (e.g., DELCOM, RageSec) and internal projects (e.g., WinterGate, ACC bot).
Note: Any further reports or provocations from TNM - The New Militia will result in the total annihilation of their network, leveraging all available resources and alliances.

Call to Action:
Allies are encouraged to utilize available data and coordinate independently if they choose to pursue TNM - The New Militia and Fanto. OPH and SRA are requested to step in where possible, leveraging our shared creed (v2, VI) of guardianship. Guidance from NoTrac3 will be limited to historical support.Closing Statement:
This withdrawal is not a surrender but a strategic pause. The work done has weakened these networks, and I trust karma and allied efforts will see it through (11:39 PM, October 15). NoTrac3 remains committed to its mission of truth and justice, unyielding in purpose (creed v2, VII). Updates will follow on new priorities.Signed,
m77u1n
Founder, NoTrac3
