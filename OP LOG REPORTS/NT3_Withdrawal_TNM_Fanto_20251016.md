# NoTrac3 Official Withdrawal Document
**Date:** October 16, 2025

**Subject:** Formal Withdrawal from Operations Against TNM - The New Militia and Fanto

**To:** The NoTrac3 Alliance, OPH, SRA, and Allied Networks,

After months of dedicated effort to dismantle the TNM - The New Militia and Fanto networks, I, m77u1n (AnonCatalyst_), hereby announce the official withdrawal of NoTrac3 from these operations, effective immediately. This decision stems from the critical failure to receive an updated victim report, which was essential to completing the mission.

## Background
Since the official investigation was announced on 2025-08-09 under OPERATION IRONFALL: TARGET GROUP LOG REPORT by the Covenant Intel Division, NoTrac3 has invested significant resources—intelligence gathering, psyops execution (ISOLATE, DEGRADE, ERASE), and alliance coordination—to cripple TNM - The New Militia and Fanto. Our efforts have successfully paused their operations and exposed vulnerabilities, notably through the DTAD database (1,750+ accounts) and UTTP linkages. However, the absence of a new victim report, lost due to circumstances beyond my control, has halted progress on the erasure phase.

## Reason for Withdrawal
The withdrawal is necessitated by a series of insurmountable challenges tied to the victim report's unavailability. Initially, the report was a cornerstone for legal and operational precision, providing detailed evidence to finalize the takedown of TNM - The New Militia and Fanto. However, repeated delays and a complete lack of cooperation from the primary victim source—stemming from distrust and unwillingness to engage (11:19 PM, October 15)—have undermined the mission's feasibility. This betrayal, following months of my personal investment (11:23 PM), including the loss of a prior report due to external factors, has left NoTrac3 without the critical data needed to proceed ethically and effectively. The emotional and operational toll, compounded by burnout (11:39 PM), has rendered further pursuit untenable, forcing this strategic pause to preserve resources and focus.

## Current Status
- TNM - The New Militia and Fanto remain isolated and degraded but not fully erased.
- Existing intel (e.g., UTTP associations) remains available for allied use.
- NoTrac3 will redirect focus to other threats (e.g., DELCOM, RageSec) and internal projects (e.g., WinterGate, ACC bot).
- **Warning:** Any further reports or provocations from TNM - The New Militia will be met with the full force of NoTrac3, unleashing all available resources, alliances (OPH, SRA), and advanced tools (DTAD, ACC bot) to put an end to TNM entirely. This includes comprehensive doxxing, network annihilation, and coordination with federal entities to ensure their complete dismantlement. This measure is a direct response to the repeated failures and provocations that have jeopardized this operation, serving as a final deterrent to prevent future escalation.

## Call to Action
Allies are encouraged to utilize available data and coordinate independently if they choose to pursue TNM - The New Militia and Fanto. OPH and SRA are requested to step in where possible, leveraging our shared creed (v2, VI) of guardianship. Guidance from NoTrac3 will be limited to historical support.

## Closing Statement
This withdrawal is not a surrender but a strategic pause. The work done has weakened these networks, and I trust karma and allied efforts will see it through (11:39 PM, October 15). NoTrac3 remains committed to its mission of truth and justice, unyielding in purpose (creed v2, VII). Updates will follow on new priorities.
