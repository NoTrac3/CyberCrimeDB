## OPERATION IRONFALL: TARGET GROUP COMISSION REPORT
__DATE: 2025-08-09  | SOURCE:__ `COVENANT INTEL DIVISION`

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NoTrac3 Covenant has uncovered a sophisticated multi-server extremist network 
operating across Discord and affiliated platforms. Designated "Operation Ironfall," 
this investigation reveals a coordinated ecosystem of anti-social groups engaged in 
illegal activities including distribution of child abuse material, hate speech, 
and organized cyber harassment campaigns.

PRIMARY GROUPS IDENTIFIED:

1. THE NEW MILITIA (TNM) [CORE NODE]
   - Server ID: 1393298755931082975
   - Member Count: 215+ 
   - Creation: July 2025
   - Key Finding: Infant abuse imagery confirmed
   - Subsidiaries: Multiple linked servers (84bKSGhQe8, Ru7hmrVh, zZGHC9XWEd)

2. UNIVERSAL UNION (ꕺ𒀖) [TECHNICAL HUB]  
   - Server ID: 1333700955648032808
   - Member Count: 731+
   - Creation: January 2025
   - Capabilities: OSINT tools, DDoS, botnets, encryption, raid coordination
   - Ideology: Technocratic assimilation ("UAP" doctrine: Unite, Assimilate, Progress)

3. HAISTER (壊滅) [AGGRESSIVE ARM]
   - Server ID: (Pending full enumeration) 
   - Member Count: 577+
   - Stated Purpose: "Absolute degeneracy hunting"
   - Targeting: LGBTQ+, furries, satanists, "enemies"
   - Tactics: Doxxing, leaking, raiding, spam bots

4. 148 NETWORK [ALLY]
   - Server ID: 1401665256836563105  
   - Member Count: 55+ exported users
   - Function: Recruitment funnel to larger network
```
CONFIRMED HIERARCHY:
[Δ] Universal Union (UU) [TOP]
    ↳ [Δ] The New Militia (TNM) / The Militia (TM) [CORE]
        ↳ [Δ] Kinder Wotan
        ↳ [Δ] Haister (壊滅)
        ↳ [Δ] The Crusader Forces (TCF)
        ↳ [Δ] Cheese Army / Petorian Tavern
        ↳ [Δ] Multiple "TaverN" style servers (recruitment fronts)
        ↳ [Δ] Synisterria Cult
        ↳ [Δ] Las Vegas Server (media/propaganda wing)

OPERATIONAL STATUS: The network is largely stagnant ("limited or inactive").
   Their activity is a facade. The Petorian Tavern, however, showed significant
   historical data (12,268 messages, 852 files), indicating it was a former hub.

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This network is a ghost. It is the decaying remnant of the old "ClanCom" era,
attempting to rebrand and reorganize under the Universal Union banner. Their
power is not in their current capabilities, which are minimal, but in their
persistent ideology and potential for recruitment.

However, their complete lack of operational security (OPSEC) makes them
critically vulnerable. I walked through every server unchallenged. They are
a talking shop, not a threat—but a talking shop that can still radicalize.
