[2025-09-11 20:38:57] m77u1n#0: im still investigating TM is cant decide that right now
[2025-09-11 20:39:27] drip.cad#0: https://discord.gg/CVnfXwGV
[2025-09-11 20:39:32] drip.cad#0: do you know who owns the server
[2025-09-11 20:40:02] m77u1n#0: i dont know why your messaging me like this arent you in TM/TNM
[2025-09-11 20:40:10] drip.cad#0: yeah
[2025-09-11 20:40:11] drip.cad#0: i own it
[2025-09-11 20:40:49] m77u1n#0: makes sense and your real close to DPOS and 148
[2025-09-11 20:41:03] drip.cad#0: not really
[2025-09-11 20:41:04] drip.cad#0: in fact
[2025-09-11 20:41:08] drip.cad#0: i dont know what DPOS is
[2025-09-11 20:41:13] drip.cad#0: also we dislike 148
[2025-09-11 20:41:23] drip.cad#0: they used child abuse material in their server raids
[2025-09-11 20:41:27] drip.cad#0: we firmly disagree with it
[2025-09-11 20:42:06] m77u1n#0: i went into one of your entry servers and ran into a bloody baby and ive seen more
[2025-09-11 20:42:25] drip.cad#0: are you saying you dont like bloody babies
[2025-09-11 20:43:59] drip.cad#0: what is DPOS
[2025-09-11 20:45:16] m77u1n#0: i believe i already have access to that server and all the rest also the UU and any other allies. What is your purpose for messaging me because with Tomas having the FBI after him now i can focus on investigating TNM/TM and why TNM is associating with UTTP/DPOS members/superiors.
[2025-09-11 20:46:00] m77u1n#0: and why I have spotted your members in 148 entry servers
[2025-09-11 20:46:12] m77u1n#0: or are you just not aware of what your members are up too
[2025-09-11 20:46:27] drip.cad#0: do you think i control my members
[2025-09-11 20:46:30] drip.cad#0: they have free will
[2025-09-11 20:46:38] drip.cad#0: they can join and leave whatever server they desire
[2025-09-11 20:46:56] m77u1n#0: your after 148 and such but you have members who roll with your enemies
[2025-09-11 20:47:41] m77u1n#0: counter intuitive a bit redundant
[2025-09-11 20:48:13] drip.cad#0: we arent after 148
[2025-09-11 20:48:24] drip.cad#0: it is a more neutral relationship now
[2025-09-11 20:48:36] drip.cad#0: we dont care for eachother, me and roach havent talked in ages
[2025-09-11 20:49:21] m77u1n#0: SO are you gonna tell me why your talking to me because I just got back from work
[2025-09-11 20:49:37] drip.cad#0: where do you work

[2025-09-11 20:50:39] drip.cad#0: only my age
[2025-09-11 20:50:41] drip.cad#0: was correct
[2025-09-11 20:50:49] drip.cad#0: why not
[2025-09-11 20:50:52] drip.cad#0: we are almost friends
[2025-09-11 20:51:31] m77u1n#0: i think your here for other reasons it doesnt make sense for you to be messaging me
[2025-09-11 20:51:48] drip.cad#0: im just curious
[2025-09-11 20:51:53] drip.cad#0: also
