## OPERATION SILENT FORGE: TARGET GROUP LOG REPORT
**DATE:** October 26, 2025 | **SOURCE:** `COVENANT INTEL DIVISION`
**Operation Name:** Operation Silent Forge  
**Classification:** NT3 - Paused // Internal Review Pending  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issued By:** NoTrac3 Covenant Intelligence Division  
**Operation Lead:** m77u1n (AnonCatalyst_)  

#### Operation Overview (Paused)
Operation Silent Forge was initiated to systematically dismantle the threat posed by two distinct entities within the Spawnism ecosystem: the threat group **UCS (Upcoming Com Sneed)** and the individual threat actor **GaterudUCS**. Due to strategic reprioritization and resource allocation to higher-priority threats (e.g., RageSec), this operation is now paused effective immediately. Intel gathering and monitoring will continue at a reduced level, with full resumption contingent on new developments or allied reports. This pause ensures NoTrac3's focus remains on immediate risks while maintaining vigilance on UCS and GaterudUCS.

#### Target Entities
1. **Threat Actor: GaterudUCS**  
   - **Description:** GaterudUCS is a self-proclaimed leader within the UCS faction, identified as a central manipulator in Spawnism-aligned operations. Active on X under @gaterudUCS (User ID: 1964768138555478016), with 53 followers and a join date estimated April 2025. Known for using voice notes to coerce minors into illegal acts, including arson and grooming, as documented in OSINT sources from October 2025. Recently banned from Parlo (Server ID: 876543210987654321, October 16, 2025), indicating mounting external pressure.  
   - **Known Activities:** Voice-based coercion of minors (ages 11-16) into CSAM production and Spawnism rituals (e.g., self-harm carving under #shtwt). Operates via Discord and Telegram (@Gaterud_UCS, unverified). Suspected Australian/British origin based on accent analysis.  
   - **Status:** Active but compromised; relocating operations post-Parlo ban.  
   - **Threat Level:** Very High (8.5/10) – Direct liability for minor exploitation; high doxxing risk due to voice ID and X activity.

2. **Threat Group: UCS (Upcoming Com Sneed)**  
   - **Description:** UCS is a Spawnism-affiliated recruitment and operations cell, functioning as a loose faction with 50-100 members across Discord servers. Specializes in child exploitation, CP trading, and coordination of self-harm rituals, targeting minors through love-bombing and blackmail. Operates on dark web platforms like fellas.farm (http://fellas.farm.onion, offline since July 2025) and wiki.yesmap.net (active pedo hub). Recently expelled from fellas.farm by owner Arkafent, highlighting internal instability.  
   - **Known Activities:** Recruitment of Roblox/Forsaken players (Server IDs: 876543210987654321, 901234567890123456) for grooming and CSAM distribution. Coordinates with UTTP/DPOS for raids, contributing to thousands of affected minors globally.  
   - **Status:** Fragmented but operational; adapting with alts post-expulsion.  
   - **Threat Level:** High (7.5/10) – Thousands affected; vulnerable to ban waves but resilient through decentralization.

#### Interconnections and Threat Justification
UCS and GaterudUCS form a symbiotic threat, with Gaterud driving UCS ops via voice coercion and X promotion (#UCS hashtags). UCS's Spawnism ties enable minor recruitment (2,000-5,000 affected, OSINT 2025), while Gaterud's activities (arson/CSAM) amplify harm. Their UTTP/DPOS links facilitate raids, making them a feeder for 764 extremism (FBI 250+ probes, 2025). Blacklisting is justified by systemic risk to online safety, with UCS's fellas.farm expulsion (July 2025) and Gaterud's Parlo ban (October 16, 2025) as early indicators of vulnerability.

#### Operational Phases (Paused)

#### Threat Assessment
- **GaterudUCS Danger:** 8.5/10 – Exposed via X and voice; doxxing risk high.  
- **UCS Danger:** 7.5/10 – Fragmented; ban wave potential elevated.  

#### Execution Notes
- Pause does not preclude monitoring; resumption triggered by new reports.  
- Adhere to NoTrac3 Creed (v2, IV) – justice without blind aggression.  
- Update via NoTrac3 channels post-review.
