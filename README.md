## OPERATION SILENT FORGE: TARGET GROUP LOG REPORT
**DATE:** October 26, 2025 | **SOURCE:** `COVENANT INTEL DIVISION`

### Operation Overview
Operation Silent Forge is a strategic initiative launched by NoTrac3 to address and neutralize the threats posed by two distinct entities within the Spawnism ecosystem: the threat group UCS (Upcoming Com Sneed) and the individual threat actor GaterudUCS. This log documents the official marking of these targets and outlines the current understanding of their activities and threats.

### Target Entities
1. **Threat Actor: GaterudUCS**  
   - **Identity:** Gaterud, an Australian/British individual operating under the X handle @gaterudUCS (ID: 1964768138555478016), is a key leader within the UCS faction. Known for manipulating minors into illegal activities, including arson coercion and grooming, with evidence shared via X posts by @cryonyxo on October 1 and 4, 2025. Recently banned from Parlo, signaling increased external pressure.
   - **Status:** Active but vulnerable, with a history of evading scrutiny through role-playing tactics (e.g., framing YouTubers like KreekCraft).

2. **Threat Group: UCS (Upcoming Com Sneed)**  
   - **Description:** UCS is a Spawnism-affiliated faction functioning as a recruitment and operations cell, primarily operating on Discord and dark web platforms. Engages in child exploitation, CP trading, and coordination of self-harm rituals, targeting minors through love-bombing and blackmail. Recently expelled from fellas.farm by owner Arkafent, indicating internal instability.
   - **Status:** Fragmented but operational, with a network tied to broader Spawnism and UTTP activities, affecting thousands of minors.

### Threat Assessment
- **GaterudUCS Threat Level:** Very High (8/10) – As a central figure, his exposure increases the risk of targeted action, though his adaptability poses a challenge.
- **UCS Threat Level:** High (7/10) – Vulnerable due to recent setbacks, but capable of regrouping if not fully dismantled.

### Operational Context
- **Initiation:** Marked officially on October 26, 2025, following intel from allied sources (e.g., -----tsr, October 16, 2025).
- **Objective:** Disrupt UCS operations and isolate GaterudUCS, with potential for escalated action if new reports emerge.
- **Notes:** This log serves as the foundation for ongoing investigations, with updates to follow as Operation Silent Forge progresses.
