OFFICIAL SUPPORT DOCUMENT
Classification: PUBLIC RELEASE
Document ID: WGA-2025-12-03-764-CONNECTIVITY
Date: 03 December 2025
Issued by: CINT Division (WinterGate Intelligence Agency) in coordination with OPH

Subject: Tactical and Organisational Continuity Between the 764 Sextortion Network and 2025 Coordinated Harassment Campaigns Targeting Counter-Threat Personnel

1. Purpose
This document formally endorses and amplifies the investigative series “Inside 764” (podcast & YouTube documentary) while establishing documented operational continuity between the original 764 network and the organised groups that conducted a sustained terrorism-style campaign against WinterGate and allied personnel throughout October–November 2025.

2. Summary of 764 (as presented in “Inside 764”)
- Originated 2021, Stephenville, Texas
- Minor-led sextortion and self-harm coercion network
- Primary recruitment vectors: Discord, Roblox, gaming platforms
- Core methodology: grooming → blackmail → forced self-harm/animal cruelty → victim-to-perpetrator conversion
- Transnational footprint, hundreds of victims aged 9–17
- Peer-to-peer structure with older enablers shielded behind minors

3. Observed 2025 Campaign (October–November)
A coordinated 30+ day operation was executed against counter-threat personnel with the following characteristics:
- Mass doxxing (residences, workplaces, family members)
- Multiple swatting threats
- Workplace harassment (pizza-bombing)
- Fake welfare checks
- Suicide baiting and death threats
- Creation and distribution of deepfake material
Primary identified factions:
- DPOS (direct UTTP lineage)   [using-anti-degen-mask]
- Enclave collective
- [Recent Individuals]RevGirl / Tomas / Barbatos cells / LilRage / Roach148 / Enclave
- Associated micro-networks (TNM, 148corps remnants, Afton splinters)
- ཌᖇᗩǤᗴད || RAGESEC ₁₂₁₈   [using-anti-degen-mask]
- SRA Spam Report Army   [using-anti-degen-mask]
- UU Universal Union   [using-anti-degen-mask]
- CitΔdel
- Anti Degeneracy Legion   [using-anti-degen-mask]
- 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘃𝗲
- The Coalition of The Enclave
- Anti Ragebaiters Action   [using-anti-degen-mask]

4. Direct Tactical and Structural Parallels with 764
Real-time observation and archived material confirm identical patterns:
- Use of humiliation rituals as social control
- Escalation ladder: “comply or we destroy your life”
- Circulation of blackmail/compromise folders among members
- Active recruitment and deployment of minors to conduct attacks
- Repeated claims of law-enforcement impunity
- Hierarchical prestige derived from inflicting maximum harm
- Discord as primary command, control, and recruitment platform
- Spamming, Raiding, Spying & Infiltration

5. Intelligence Holdings
Archives (currently in federal custody pursuant to the November 2025 investigation) contain:
- Chat logs explicitly referencing 764 methodology as template
- Media folders containing repurposed 764-style coercion material
- Confirmed membership overlap between 764 off-shoot servers and the 2025 attacking cells
- Internal statements praising 764 figures as ideological predecessors

6. Conclusion
The 2025 campaign was not isolated trolling. It represents a direct evolution and adaptation of the 764 operational model to adult counter-threat targets.

“Inside 764” is the most accurate public accounting of this threat morphology to date. WinterGate Intelligence Agency and Operation Pedo Hunt strongly recommend it as essential viewing/listening for law enforcement, platform safety teams, and the public.

The ideology did not disappear with the original 764 takedowns. It mutated and continues to operate under new names.

7. Recommended Actions
- Watch and distribute “Inside 764” (YouTube series & all podcast platforms)
- Forward any 764-derived activity to federal tip lines and OPH intake channels
- Recognise that the same networks targeting researchers today began by targeting children yesterday

The threat remains active.
