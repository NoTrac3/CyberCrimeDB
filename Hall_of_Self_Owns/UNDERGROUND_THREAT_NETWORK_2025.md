File Name: EXPOSURE_UNDERGROUND_THREAT_NETWORK_2025.txt

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE AUTHORITATIVE PUBLIC RECORD
Everything contained here is confirmed through direct logs, screenshots, packet traces, and real-time activations.
This is the most complete mapping ever released of the current underground threat network.
It is still only the visible top layer. More exists. Updates will be appended as new branches and names are verified.

## Complete Known Historical Timeline

**2017–2019: Pre-history**  
Small YouTube comment armies and early Discord raid crews.  
Tactics limited to spam and annoyance.

**2019–2020: Classic Troll Era**  
UTTP, PD, TT, TH, and hundreds of copycats dominate.  
Primary tactics: mass comment spam, voice-chat screaming, server crashing, cringe videos.  
Real-world harm: effectively zero.

**2020–2021: First Real Escalation**  
Doxxing becomes a status symbol.  
Gore spam appears as a weapon.  
First scattered swatting incidents recorded.

**2021–2022: The 764 / Spawnism Explosion**  
764, 621, CVLT, Harm Nation, and related rings go fully public.  
Tactics: CSAM extortion, self-harm manipulation, suicide baiting, organized swatting, real-life stalking.  
Multiple confirmed deaths worldwide.  
Law enforcement begins large-scale global response.

**2022–2023: Global Takedown Wave**  
Hundreds of 764-style servers deleted.  
Dozens of arrests.  
Chat logs seized across multiple continents.

**2023–2024: Fragmentation & Merger Phase**  
Surviving 764 members scatter.  
They migrate into the only surviving large platforms: the decaying classic troll networks (UTTP remnants, DPOS, etc.).  
They bring swatting contacts, gore collections, and real-world tactics.  
Troll networks supply thousands of fresh recruits and the perfect public cover: "anti-degen raiding."

**2024–2025: The Hybrid Threat Network Is Fully Formed**  
Old troll scale + 764 darkness = the current underground ecosystem.  
Swatting is now routine.  
Gore is a psychological weapon.  
Death threats are casual.  
"Anti-degen" becomes the universal camouflage while protecting predators in private channels.

## Known Core Branches – The Visible Top Layer (November 2025)

**RageSec**  
Role: Phone terrorism division  
Specialties: swatting, pizza bombing, fake welfare checks, emergency-service abuse  
Leadership: lilrage  
Estimated active members: 100–180

**Enclave / UETR**  
Role: Gore, shock media, and automated bot division  
Specialties: mass gore drops, token grabbers, account nuking, psychological breakage  
Leadership: Ethan  
Estimated active members: 120–200

**DPOS / UTTP remnants**  
Role: Death-threat core and long-term stalking division  
Specialties: edited revenge images, suicide baiting, family targeting, years-long campaigns  
Leadership: Emperor T (supreme commander), rxmwmcrx limited (gore/image specialist), General Sanguinius (planning & scheduling)  
Estimated active members: 70–130

**Universal Union (UU)**  
Role: Infrastructure backbone  
Specialties: backup servers, alt-account factories, invite networks, evidence deletion support  
Leadership: rotating / deliberately hidden  
Estimated nodes: 200–400

**Anti-Degen Legion**  
Role: Public face and amplification wing  
Specialties: X/TikTok smear campaigns, fake exposés, narrative control, viral defamation  
Leadership: Serin  
Estimated loose affiliates: 400–800

**DecafJokers – SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION**  
Not a real group.  
A single-owner vanity server run exclusively by one individual (RevGirl).  
Functions as a one-girl meme army.  
No shared leadership, no independent structure.  
Included solely because its owner repeatedly plugged it into the larger network and accidentally created the clearest operational exposure in history through her own coordination screenshots.  
The ultimate self-ownage case study.

## Known Feeder & Support Layer (partial list – constantly expanding)

- Weekly "anti-degen" branded Discords  
- Private invite-only raid planning servers  
- Spawnism tribute circles  
- TikTok-specific raid squads  
- Throwaway UTTP/PD revival attempts  
- Quiet gore-sharing hubs  
- New "hunting" groups that mirror core playbook  
- Unnamed private servers that only activate on big packets

## The Packet Activation Cycle – Complete Operational Flow

**Phase 1:** Packet acquisition (insider, ex-friend, or stolen data)  
**Phase 2:** Courier delivery – identical file pushed to every core branch within 2–6 hours  
**Phase 3:** Simultaneous multi-branch strike – calls, gore, threats, smears all launch together  
**Phase 4:** Sustained campaign – temporary dispatcher keeps branches synced for days/weeks  
**Phase 5:** Cleanup & mutation – servers delete evidence, names change, alts burn, wait for next packet

## Hard Proof of Unity – Shared Infrastructure

- Same invite links valid across multiple branches  
- Same raid bots operating under different names  
- Identical cropped images and text files posted by 4–6 groups in the same hour  
- Same private gore/CSAM channels linked between branches  
- Same victim lists circulating unchanged for years

## Recruitment & Self-Replication Engine

Standard path for new blood:  
Viral raid clip on TikTok/X → joins feeder server → small raids to prove loyalty → invited deeper → reaches core branch → becomes recruiter themselves

## The Universal Camouflage

Every branch, feeder, and new server uses the exact same public story:  
"We're anti-degen"  
"We only target pedos"  
"It's just raiding"

Reality:  
They shield known groomers.  
They share CSAM links in private.  
They attack anyone who actually exposes child exploitation material.

## Current Status – 19 November 2025

The entire merged network activated on one target in November 2025 and left a complete, public, timestamped operational trail.  
One solo vanity-server owner accidentally delivered the clearest blueprint ever seen by playing general from her meme army for two weeks.

The visible top layer is now fully mapped, named, and archived forever.

More layers exist.  
They will be added when confirmed.

All raw evidence folders are public and permanent:

NoTrac3 Covenant – 19 November 2025  
This is the most complete public exposure of the underground threat network ever released.  
It is only the beginning.

End of record
Future confirmed branches, names, and layers will be appended.
